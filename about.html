                <h2>A talented artist and graphic designer Sun Mi Chang</h2>
                <p>Sun Mi Chang spent her childhood in Seoul, Korea. At that time, the neighborhood where Sun Mi lived had small mountains, fields, and a public playground. 
                <p>Although Sun Mi was poor in her childhood and didn't have the toys that other children bought from stores, everything around her became her toys.  She would stick cosmos petals on her nails, playing house with broken dishes, and the slide in the playground would sometimes become a spaceship to another dimension.</p>
                <p>Not only that, when she wanted a Barbie doll, she made her own doll out of cloth, and she also enjoyed drawing pictures with pencils and making small books and various toys with paper.</p>
                <p>Such poverty, rather than having complete toys, served as an opportunity to spark Sun Mi's interest in creation. Among them, drawing stimulated Sun Mi's imagination and became a means of expressing herself and objects.<p>
                Sun Mi, who liked to imagine and was quiet, liked to draw doodles or cartoons of the emotions or images she felt herself, and sometimes she drew the faces of famous celebrities for her friends. This was very popular in her class. Sun Mi's interest in creation was expanded through art class.</p>
                <p>In Korea, art classes allowed them to try various types of mediums, crafts, and sculptures, which became an important awakening for Sun Mi's artistic senses, and she became known as a good artist in her class. Her art teacher, who discovered Sun Mi's talent for art, suggested that she go to an art college.</p> 
                <p>However, various difficult home environments made her give up art college and enter a regular college. In the end, Sun Mi gave up her dream and lived to adapt to reality, but her interest in art did not disappear. Her interest in art continued into all areas of life, such as collaging children's photos or making some crafts and decorating something.</p>
                <p> Amid such circumstances, once her children had all grown up, she got the opportunity to do what she wanted in the United States. She thought that through a computer, she could fully express her imagination and have a job doing what she liked, so she chose graphic design as her major without hesitation. Thus, she entered Bergen Community College and learned not only graphic design but also fine arts in a professional way.</p> 
                <p>This awakened her dormant creativity and helped her to cultivate a broader perspective on art. The more she learned, the more she felt a thirst for art, and she think she wants to live her remaining life with art. She also wants to see how far her talent could develop.</p>
